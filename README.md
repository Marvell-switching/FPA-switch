# FPA-switch

The Forwarding Plane Abstraction (FPA) logical switch model is an abstract
switch API for configuring the MarvellÂ® Prestera devices.

The FPA provides API calls to
support interrogating tables for certain capabilities. These capabilities can include supported match
fields, actions, instructions, and more. They can also include status properties, such as current
resource usage.
The FPA model proves to be an efficient and modular programming approach API library.
